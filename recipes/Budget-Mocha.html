        <h2> A simple yet effective budget friendly way to enjoy coffee sticks better </h2>

        <p>Coffee is drank by many before doing anything productive, but when we try to save money, coffee doesn't hit the same. Well atleast stick coffe won't. I made this recipe because I wanted to drink coffee, but need a sweet flavor to accompany the bitterness </p>

        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 piece coffee stick </li>

            <li> 1 sachet of milo </li>

            <li> hot water and cold water </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> How to breww </h2>

        <ol>
            <li> pour 1 coffee stick into mug and at a lil bit of cold water(just enough to mix it) <em>this is so that the drink won't be as bitter</em> <strong>*Trust me bro* </strong></li>

            <li> pour in 1 sachet of milo into the same mug and mix </li>

            <li> fill the mug with hot water, but not completely and <strong>SIP ON IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT </strong> </li>
        </ol>
