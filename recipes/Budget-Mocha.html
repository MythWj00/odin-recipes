        <h2> A simple yet effective budget friendly way to enjoy coffee sticks better </h2>

        <p>Coffee is drank by many before doing anything productive, but when we try to save money, coffee doesn't hit the same. Well atleast stick coffe won't. I made this recipe because I wanted to drink coffee, but need a sweet flavor to accompany the bitterness </p>
