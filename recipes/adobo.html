        <h2> A traditional Filipino dish composed of meat, usually chicken or pork, cooked in a dark sauce, served over a bed of hot rice </h2>

        <p> A childhood dish to many filipinos inside and outside the Philippines. The adobo, whether chicken or pork has been consumed by everyone with a filipino guardian cooking it for them. And it <strong><em>MIGHT</em></strong> be the <em>best meat you'll ever try</em> <strong>* PAUSE *</strong> in your limited existence. </p>

        <p> The sweet and savoury flavours imbedded in the meat, combined with the <em>sticky glaze</em> <strong>*PAUSE*</strong> makes for a dangerously good combination with a mountain-like plate of rice</p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 3 pounds(around 1.36kg) of meat(preferrably chicken or pork) </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons of oil </li>
            <li> 4 tablespoons of minced garlic(or as many as u can safetly eat) </li>
            <li> 1 large onion, thinly sliced </li>
            <li> 2/3 cup of all purpose soy sauce </li>
            <li> 1/3 cup of vinegar </li>
            <li> 4 tablespoon brown sugar </li>
            <li> 4 pieces of bay leaves </li>
            <li> 1/2 cup of water </li>
            <li> 1/3 cup of sprite (after water has been reduced)</li>
            <li> chives for garnish </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> How to actually make it </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large plastic container place <strong> UNWASHED MEAT </strong> (If it's bought from store)</li>

            <li> Dump <strong><em>2 table spoons</em></strong> of minced garlic, the 2/3 cup of all purpose soy sauce, 1/3 cup of vinegar, 4 tablespoons of brown sugar, and 4 pieces of bay leaves into the bowl with the chicken inside it already </li>

            <li> <strong><em>*CRUCIAL FOR FLAVOR*</em></strong> <em>Wait atleast 30 minutes to marinade the meat </em> </li>

            <li> Heat up a pan <em> putting your hand above it makes your hand hot</em> </li>

            <li> pour the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil into the <em>hot</em> pan, swirl the oil around until oil fully covers the bottom of pan </li>

            <li>Now with metal tongs, carefully place the meat inside the hot pain with the hot oil, we want <strong><em>browning</em></strong> here, not cooking it through </li>

            <li>Flip it if one side is <strong> colored brown</strong>(can be dark brown dw) repeat until all pieces of meat is "browned" on both sides</li>

            <li>let pan cool down a bit(should be no smokey bussiness). Then add the thinly sliced onions. Wait 1 minute, then add the minced garlic as well </li>

            <li>Pour in the "marinade" we made inside the pan with the garlic and onions</li>

            <li>Place the browned meat back again inside the pan <em>very demurely</em> </li>

            <li>Add the 1/2 cup of water into the pan, bring to a simmer, partially cover, wait 35 minutes on <em>low heat</em> </li>

            <li>After the 35 minutes, add the 1/2 cup of sprite into the pan, reduce until desired consistency.<strong> "ITS ITS GRIPPY STICKY"</strong> </li>

            <li> FINALLY, garnish with chives <strong> and taste your CREATION</strong> </li>
    
        </ol>
