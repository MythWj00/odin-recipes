        <h2> A traditional Filipino dish composed of meat, usually chicken or pork, cooked in a dark sauce, served over a bed of hot rice </h2>

        <p> A childhood dish to many filipinos inside and outside the Philippines. The adobo, whether chicken or pork has been consumed by everyone with a filipino guardian cooking it for them. And it <strong><em>MIGHT</em></strong> be the <em>best meat you'll ever try</em> <strong>* PAUSE *</strong> in your limited existence. </p>

        <p> The sweet and savoury flavours imbedded in the meat, combined with the <em>sticky glaze</em> <strong>*PAUSE*</strong> makes for a dangerously good combination with a mountain-like plate of rice</p>
